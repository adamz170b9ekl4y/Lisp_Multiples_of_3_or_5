Goal of this is to learn lisp using 'Project Euler'. 'Project Euler' contains numerous mathematical problems which while solvable by hand, are more suted to be done by computer algorithms. 

Current Problems Solved
1: Multiples of 3 or 5
2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
3: Largest Prime Factor
5: Smallest Multiple
6: Sum Square Difference
7: 10001th Prime
10: Summation of Primes
16: Power Digit Sum
