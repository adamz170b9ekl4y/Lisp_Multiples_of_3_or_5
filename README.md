Goal of this is to learn lisp using 'Project Euler'. 'Project Euler' contains numerous mathematical problems which while solvable by hand, are more suted to be done by computer algorithms. 

Current Problems Solved
1: Multiples of 3 or 5
2: Even Fibonacci Numbers
3: Largest Prime Factor
4: Largest Palindrome Product
5: Smallest Multiple
6: Sum Square Difference
7: 10001th Prime
8: Largest Product in a Series
10: Summation of Primes
13: Large Sum
14: Longest Collatz Sequence
16: Power Digit Sum
